# Jason for WordPress

This is a simple port of [Jason](https://github.com/Circa75/jason) by [Jason Schuller](http://jason.sc) to a WordPress theme. Pick a static page at reading setting, then add a couple of menus - one for social links, other - for work timeline. Social link menu will recognize some standard social networks automatically. And for Work menu the title has to be in this format: `TItle of the compan or position|20xx-20yy`. Use Site Logo feature to change Jason's photo to an image of your choosing.
